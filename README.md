# This language is not done yet and coming soon

Wsharp is an easy to use programming language, its made with c++ and enspired by swift
also it has a flexible package manager whit lots of free to use scripts

# Example codes
Some important things to note:
- To use certain libraries, you need to use "depends" and then type the name of the package
- "global" means public 
- To make comments you use "#" or "//"

More info is coming soon, when I got more stuff done.

## Temperature

```
depends system

global func main(input) {
    string temperatre = getinput("Whats the temperature: );
    if (temperature < 20) {
        displayline("Its cold today");
    } 
    elif (temperature > 20) {
        displayline("Its hot today");
    }
} 
```

   display("Hello, world");
